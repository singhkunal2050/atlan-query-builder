Task - Atlan Frontend Engineering

💡 Outline
Create, design and implement a web-based application capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query. The application must include a space which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application..

Please note:
This is a dummy application.
You must include a space to accept SQL queries. This can be as simple as a textarea or as complex as a full-blown code-editor. This does not figure in the judging criteria though.
Your application does not need to have a backend, a query engine or query validation.
You do not need to add any syntax validation.
The data that your application displays can be any chunk of data. It does not need to be the actual result that the query would display if it was actually run. You can choose any block of data from here or you can choose any other data source. The data and the query do not need to be in sync.
You can write down any query you wish. The query is not important, nor is the result. You are free to put in dummy stubs and mocks wherever the need arises.
Your application must have more than one query accompanied by its corresponding table of data. You can have a predefined set of queries and a predefined set of tables showing some data.




Breakdown
Ideation 💡
Put on your thinking caps for this stage. Think of all the features you feel would be mandatory for this application. Features that make the application just usable. Something that, if removed, would render the whole application pointless. For example, a form is usable only if it has inputs and a way to submit the given form.
Now that you have a list of essential and crucial features, start thinking of features that will add more value to your application, features that act as top-ups, cherries on the cake, if you will. These additional features make your application more useful and make your user’s life a tad bit easier. Think of forms with inputs, buttons, and custom field validations.
Assume that a data analyst is going to use your application for an entire day. What are the features that will help them breeze through the day’s workload?
Design 🧑🏻‍🎨
This part mainly tests your ability to predict your user’s behaviour, anticipate how they would use your product and the way you go about enhancing the user flow or the user experience.
Design is important for the user experience, but prioritize functionality and usability over intricate visual elements.
Implementation ⚒️
That’s it. You have the list of features you wish to implement and the layout of those features. Now, get to coding, but only after you’ve gone through the Notes below.


Evaluation Criteria
How well did you think out and plan the core and advanced functionalities of your application?
Did you take into account the most basic needs of your user?
What was your thought process behind choosing the features that you did?
What features did you include to add value to the application? Do these add value or increase complexity?
How well did you plan your layout? Does this layout enhance the overall experience for the user?
Have you anticipated the actions your user will take?
Your code structure, quality and overall readability.
The load time of your application.
The overall “snappiness” of your application: this includes the initial load time, the time taken to re-render, and the performance of the web application.
Adherence to the fundamental practices of coding.




Notes
Use a JavaScript framework for your application, such as React, Vue.js, Svelte, or any other framework. DO NOT CODE IN VANILLA JAVASCRIPT.
Host your code on a version control system, such as GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket. SEND US THE LINK TO YOUR PROJECT, NOT A ZIP FILE.
Deploy your application on services such as Netlify or Vercel, and send us the link to your deployed project. DO NOT EXPECT THE ATLAN TEAM TO INSTALL YOUR APPLICATION ON A LOCAL INSTANCE.
You are free to use any external library and dependency, as long as you mention it in the README.
In the README of your project, include the following details:
Include a concise walkthrough video, under 3 minutes, showcasing your implementation details and demonstrating how to execute queries.
The JavaScript framework you chose, along with any major plugins or packages you installed.
The page load time of your application, and how you measured this time.
Any optimisations you did to decrease the load time or increase performance.
You get brownie points if you can render a large amount of rows in your application without breaking the browser, or without crashing it. If you can’t, no biggie.
